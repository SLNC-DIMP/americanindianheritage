Native American Heritage Month came about as a result of efforts by American Indians to have recognition for the significant contributions the people of their tribes had made to the country throughout its history. Acknowledgement of these contributions first began in the 1900s and culminated with George H.W. Bush signing into the law a joint resolution that designated November as National American Indian Heritage Month (also known as Native American Indian Month).

American Indians were the original inhabitants of this country and white colonists would have failed in establishing settlements without the assistance and generosity of people from American Indian tribes. As you'll see in some of this collections resources, American Indian people have served in the military, worked as diplomats, and worked to preserve the history and culture of their tribe to pass down to younger generations.  The collection also provides resources on the different tribes of American Indians that still call North Carolina home.
