At the end of each section, the editors provide questions for reflection. Aimed at general readers and especially American Indian women themselves, this book celebrates the voices of those in native communities in the US Southeast, a region rarely covered in other publications. The editors, with deep roots in the scholarship and culture of Indian women, have collected original stories, narratives, and poems. Featured prominently is the Lumbee Indian community, where two of the editors (one of them active in the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina) teach at the nearby University of North Carolina at Pembroke College, a center for scholarship about the Lumbee people. Traditional American Indian culture places high value on teaching and passing down knowledge through story and oral history, and this volume honors that tradition with the written narratives and poetry of a variety of Native women. Through this work, provided by professional and everyday writers, readers learn about the societies that have raised girls from an early age to be independent and competent leaders, to access traditional Native spirituality despite religious oppression, and to fight for justice for themselves and Native peoples across the nation in the face of legal and societal oppression. Included in this volume is Annette Saunooke Clapsaddle who documents the work of Cherokee linguist Marie Junaluska""",multiple-page; book,"American literature--Indian authors; American literature--Women authors; Literature, Modern--21st century.; Poetry, Modern--21st century; Indian women--Southern States--Biographies; Indian women--Southern States--Social conditions--21st century.",,,,,Blair,State Library of North Carolina.

The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Now historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers a history of the United States told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire. In An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States, Dunbar-Ortiz challenges the founding myth of the United States and shows how policy against the Indigenous peoples was colonialist and designed to seize the territories of the original inhabitants, displacing or eliminating them. And as Dunbar-Ortiz reveals, this policy was praised in popular culture, through writers like James Fenimore Cooper and Walt Whitman, and in the highest offices of government and the military.

Certain cities -- such as Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital -- were greater in population than any European city. Tenochtitlán, unlike any capital in Europe at that time, had running water, beautiful botanical gardens, and immaculately clean streets. The earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians built the great pyramids. Native Americans transformed their land so completely that Europeans arrived in a hemisphere already massively ""landscaped"" by human beings.

The history of the United States and Native Americans are intertwined. Agriculture, place names, and language have all been influenced by Native American culture. The stories and history of pre- and post-colonial Tribal Nations and peoples continue to resonate and informs the geographical boundaries, laws, language and modern life. From ancient rock drawings to today's urban living, the Native American Almanac: More Than 50,000 Years of the Cultures and Histories of Indigenous Peoples traces the rich heritage of indigenous people. It is a fascinating mix of biography, pre-contact and post-contact history, current events, Tribal Nations' histories, enlightening insights on environmental and land issues, arts, treaties, languages, education, movements, and more. Ten regional chapters, including urban living, cover the narrative history, the communities, land, environment, important figures, and backgrounds of each area's Tribal Nations and peoples. The stories of 345 Tribal Nations, biographies of 400 influential figures in all walks of life, Native American firsts, awards, and statistics are covered. Over 300 photographs and illustrations bring the text to life. The most complete and affordable single-volume reference work about Native American culture available today, the Native American Almanac is a unique and valuable resource devoted to illustrating, demystifying, and celebrating the moving, sometimes difficult, and often lost history of the indigenous people of America.

Professor Fenelon draws on personal experience and the agency of understudied Native (and African) resistance leaders, to weave a story too often hidden or distorted in the annals of the academy, that remains invisible at many universities and historical societies. The book identifies three epochs of racial constructions, colonialism, and capitalism that created the USA. Indigenous nations, the first to be racialized on a global scale, African peoples, enslaved and brought to the Americas, and European immigrants. It offers a sweeping analysis of the forces driving the invasion, occupation, and exploitation of Native America and the significance of labor in American history provided by Indigenous people, Africans, and immigrants, specifically the Irish.

In this book the author takes readers on a journey across America, east to west, north to south, and around again. Young and old, women and men, speak with candor, insight, and (unknown to many non-Natives) humor about being a Native American in the twenty-first century. Many also express their thoughts about the sometimes staggeringly ignorant, if often well-meaning, non-Natives they encounter, some who do not realize Native Americans still exist, much less that they speak English, have cell phones, use the Internet, and might attend both powwows and power lunches.

Thundersticks reframes our understanding of Indians' historical relationship with guns, arguing against the notion that they prized these weapons more for the pyrotechnic terror they inspired than their efficiency as tools of war. Native peoples fully recognized the potential of firearms to assist them in their struggles against colonial forces, and mostly against one another. The smoothbore, flintlock musket was Indians' stock firearm, and its destructive potential transformed their lives. For the deer hunters east of the Mississippi, the gun evolved into an essential hunting tool. Most importantly, well-armed tribes were able to capture and enslave their neighbors, plunder wealth, and conquer territory. Arms races erupted across North America, intensifying intertribal rivalries and solidifying the importance of firearms in Indian politics and culture. Though American tribes grew dependent on guns manufactured in Europe and the United States, their dependence never prevented them from rising up against Euro-American power. The Seminoles, Blackfeet, Lakotas, and others remained formidably armed right up to the time of their subjugation. Far from being a Trojan horse for colonialism, firearms empowered American Indians to pursue their interests and defend their political and economic autonomy over two centuries""",multiple-page; book,"Firearms--North America--History; Indians of North America--Warfare--History; Indians, Treatment of--North America",,,,,The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press,State Library of North Carolina.

Award-winning historian Gregory D. Smithers brings this world to life in Native Southerners, a sweeping narrative of American Indian history in the Southeast from the time before European colonialism to the Trail of Tears and beyond. In the Native South, as in much of North America, storytelling is key to an understanding of origins and tradition--and the stories of the indigenous people of the Southeast are central to Native Southerners. Spanning territory reaching from modern-day Louisiana and Arkansas to the Atlantic coast, and from present-day Tennessee and Kentucky through Florida, this book gives voice to the lived history of such well-known polities as the Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, Chickasaws, and Choctaws, as well as smaller Native communities like the Nottoway, Occaneechi, Haliwa-Saponi, Catawba, Biloxi-Chitimacha, Natchez, Caddo, and many others. From the oral and cultural traditions of these Native peoples, as well as the written archives of European colonists and their Native counterparts, Smithers constructs a vibrant history of the societies, cultures, and peoples that made and remade the Native South in the centuries before the American Civil War. What emerges is a complex picture of how Native Southerners understood themselves and their world--a portrayal linking community and politics, warfare and kinship, migration, adaptation, and ecological stewardship--and how this worldview shaped and was shaped by their experience both before and after the arrival of Europeans""",multiple-page; book,Indians of North America--Southern States--History,,,,,University of Oklahoma Press,State Library of North Carolina.

In 1970, the Waccamaw began to organize powwows to represent publicly their Indian heritage and survival and to spread awareness of their fight for cultural preservation and independence. Lerch found herself understanding that the powwows, in addition to affirming identity, revealed important truths about the history of the Waccamaw and the ways they communicate and coexist. Waccamaw Legacy outlines Lerch's experience as she plays a vital role in the Waccamaw Siouan's continuing fight for recognition and acceptance in contemporary society and culture.",multiple-page; book,"Federally recognized Indian tribes--Southern States; Indian termination policy--Southern States; Waccamaw Indians--Ethnic identity; Waccamaw Indians--Legal status, laws, etc.; Waccamaw Indians--Tribal citizenship",,,,,University of Alabama Press,State Library of North Carolina.
